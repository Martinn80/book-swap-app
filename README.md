# Summary of the app:

This is a book swap app. Each user will create a profile and a list of books they want to read, as well as a list of books they already have and are willing to lend. The users will pop up based on their area, and there will be a suggestion for a nearby cafe where users can meet up and swap books.

# Minimal goals:

To create a database using MySQL and add information to it using Sequelize that would contain the profiles and book lists. We will also be using Node.js and Express to set up our server and back end.
Use Authentication to set up a log in system for users.
Create a polished front end for our users using HTML, CSS, BOOTSTRAP, Javascript and JQuery.
Implement the geolocatior API to map our where users are located so facilitate swapping.
List of available books in alphabetical order.

# Stretch goals:

An event API where you can follow Publishing houses and authors and add these events to a calendar.
A check in and check out date for books that would also be added to the calendar so you know when your books are due.
Open the app and have a search bar if you're looking for a quick read. Or browse by genre, author or title.
Status of the book: Is it checked out or predicted availability.
Option to put yourself on a waitlist for the book.
Option to cast a wider net for rare books.
